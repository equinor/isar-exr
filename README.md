The abbreviation "exr" stands for ExRobotics, the maker of the [ExR-2](https://exrobotics.global/robots/exr-2) robot, which this package is intended for.

Technically speaking, this package integrates to the API of [Energy Robotics](https://www.energy-robotics.com/), the provider of a cloud-based platform to control fleets of robots from multiple vendors including ExRobotics.
